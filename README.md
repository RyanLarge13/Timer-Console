# Timer Console

Handle time with this console based time management application. Set multiple
timers, alrams and start the stopwatch!

C++ for fast, safe and reliable code. Garunteed to work in any Unix based
system and is also compatable on windows systems using powershell.

This is a bare bones project. You are welcome to configure a cmake file or just
simply compile with GCC or clang

## Compiling

First make sure clang is installed. If you are on Mac it comes pre installed

[Install Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html)

1. Open a terminal
2. cd into directory

```
$ cd Timer-Console/
```

3. Check permissions

```
$ chmod 777 build.sh
```

4. Run build script using bash

```
$ ./build.sh
```

**If you ran into build errors you most likely do not have clang installed or a version of clang that is too outdated for the program. Required clang version 17+.**
