# ⏱️ Timer Console 

Handle time with this console based time management application. Set multiple
timers, alrams and start the stopwatch!

C++ for fast, safe and reliable code. Garunteed to work in any Unix based
system and is also compatable on windows systems using powershell.

This is a bare bones project. You are welcome to configure a cmake file or just
simply compile with GCC or clang

## 🏗️ Compiling 

First make sure clang is installed. If you are on Mac it comes pre installed

[Install Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html)

1. Open a terminal
2. cd into directory

```
$ cd Timer-Console/
```

3. Check permissions

```
$ chmod 777 build.sh
```

4. Run build script using bash

```
$ bash build.sh
```

**If you ran into build errors you most likely do not have clang installed or a version of clang that is too outdated for the program. Required clang version 17+.**

## Testing

### 🧪 Types of Testing With Timer Console

Here are the main types of testing relevant to this project and what should be
performed per new feature

In this project we use gtest

**Unit Testing**
Tests individual functions or classes in isolation

Should be fast and run frequently

Example: Testing a Timer::create() method

**System Testing**
Tests the entire application as a whole

Run it. Compile and run it often. Try to break it

**Regression Testing**
Ensures that new changes don’t break old functionality

Run after every change or before pushing new feature

### 🛠️ General Testing Tips With Timer Console Development

**Test often**: Write tests as you write code (test-driven development)

**Isolate units**: Avoid relying on global state or external systems for unit tests

**Automate**: Add your test scripts in ./build.sh

**Mock dependencies**: For integration testing, mock out parts of your code (e.g., nlohmann)

### Install gtest

When running build.sh gtest should be installed automatically for you and the tests already associated with the application should run. No further configuration should be necessary until new tests are created and need to be added to build.sh
